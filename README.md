# burger-logger

This application is designed to allow a user to input any burger that they'd like, and it will then appear on the screen with a "DEVOUR" button right below it. When they click the "DEVOUR" button, the burger will shift to the right of the screen, indicating that it has been devoured. Server and client-side JavaScript was used to create this project, along with MySQL, CSS, Express, and Express handlebars.
